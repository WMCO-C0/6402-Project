                            I was born at four in the morning on July 5, 1956, on a farm called La Banqueta in Cabuyaro, Meta. My parents were from Santander. I grew up by the Meta River, and on the farm we ate fish, capybara, paca, armadillo, tapir, and venison.<br>

                            I loved going fishing with my brothers. We used hooks or nets, and we baited them with worms, bits of meat, or smaller fish. During the summer, we fished in the rebalses. The rebalses happened when the river overflowed — when the water spilled out and small channels formed — and that’s where the fish stayed. When the river began to recede and those pools started to dry up in summer, there was always an abundance of fish left behind.<br><br>

                            When I was five years old, my parents separated. My father left home, and my mother stayed on the farm with my siblings and me. Things changed a lot for our family after my father left, and by the time I was seven, I had to learn how to cook. My mother would take turns with my sister and me in the kitchen — one meal she cooked, the next one I did. She would hang the pot over the stove, and I had to climb on a stool to reach it. At that age, I also had to kill and clean my first chicken, and learn how to sharpen knives and machetes. My childhood was very hard — I was too little for everything I had to face. We never went hungry, but we had to work hard, in the rice fields and at the sugar mill we owned.<br><br>

                            When I turned thirteen, I got tired of how harsh my mother was with me, so I left home to work in people’s houses and restaurants. At fourteen, I arrived in Villavicencio, and there I met the father of my children. At fifteen, I went to live with him. At sixteen, I had my first daughter — Luz Nidia Torres Gómez. I had eight children in total: Nidia, Yanet, Norma, William, Jhon, Víctor, Yeison, and Alejandro. Víctor and Jhon have already passed away.

                    When Jhon was two years old, we arrived in Bogotá, displaced by the violence. He was still a very small boy, completely dependent on me and his sisters. I had to start working to support my children — by then, there were five of them. Arriving in Bogotá was incredibly hard for me. The col-12 col-md-6d, the housing situation, people refusing to rent to someone with so many children, the long commutes, the traffic, the transport — it was all overwhelming, especially because I didn’t know the city.<br><br>

                    Living in Bogotá was very hard. I spent several years there, until one of my daughter Janeth’s classmates helped us find a house in Soacha, in the neighborhood called Compartir. It was difficult to find anyone willing to rent to someone with so many children. I eventually got used to living in Soacha, and now I’ve been there for over forty years.

                Víctor Gómez Romero was disappeared on August 23, 2008, and murdered on August 25, 2008 — an extrajudicial execution. Víctor loved dancing salsa, playing marbles, “five holes,” and “burning stick.” They all used to play together at home. My children were very close and always helped each other. Nidia was like a mother to everyone. I only asked God for strength to raise my children.

                        Llegó mi familia y yo solo pude ir a la morgue hasta las tres de la mañana, no tenía fuerzas. Cuando llegué allá, creí que lo iba a ver, que me iban a mostrar el cuerpo pero me lo mostraron en un computador, frente a otros muchachos, me preguntaron si ahí estaba Eduardo y ahí estaba mi muchacho.<br><br>
                        Era el 29 de agosto de 2008 y mi muchacho estaba en Cimitarra, no entendía por qué, me preguntaba todo, por qué, pero no hice más que coger carretera y salir a encontrarme con mi hijo. Cuando llegué allá recuerdo que lo toqué y lo sentí como gelatina; cuando lo vi reconocí el candado que tenía como barba, era mi Eduardo definitivamente.  ESTO NO ES DE CARMENZA!!!!!!! <br>

                <p><br><br>
                    I think sometimes we forget about ourselves. I sacrificed everything for my children, to the point of forgetting who I was and what I needed. Now I take care of myself and love myself more. I live alone, and I’m at peace — though I do worry that I might have a heart attack and no one would notice.<br><br>

                    If I talk about my strengths, my heart is the strongest part of me. It has taken many blows, but it keeps beating. I’ve had heart surgery and two heart attacks over the years.<br><br>

                    As for my superpowers, I think they all come from the heart — because love comes from there. Out of love for my children, I stayed alone twice and still managed to raise them.<br><br>
                    Now I really enjoy going to workshops and universities. I often think about what the memorial at the Sabana Station will be like. When I have time, I visit my children — it’s important to share time with family.<br><br>

                    I like staying at home, keeping busy, not closed off. I enjoy doing crafts, embroidery, and painting. I listen to vallenato, rancheras — all kinds of music. I love Darío Gómez, the vallenato classics, and I’m fascinated by Rafael Orozco, Los Diablitos, and Nelson Velásquez.
