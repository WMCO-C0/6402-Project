                            My name is Blanca Monroy. I was born in Uramita, Antioquia, on December 18, 1958. I am the eldest daughter of María Oliva Varela and Arturo Monroy, and I have two younger sisters, Edilma and Hilda.<br><br>

                            Since I was a little girl, I traveled with my father, who was a mule driver — a man who transported coffee or any kind of cargo on mules through the mountains.
                            Back then, in the 1950s, my father would lead around forty mules loaded with coffee, corn, and beans, and sometimes I would go with him.
                            When we had to move from one farm to another, the whole family traveled on the mules: my mother, my sisters, and all of our belongings.<br><br>

                            When I was seven years old, we lived in Santa Rita de Ituango, in a humble house where the kitchen was separate and had a large stone stove with a wooden beam, a pole really, where we hung the pots.
                            I remember seeing that huge stove, and when I had to help cook, I would climb onto a little bench so I could pour water into the pots.
                            In that kitchen, we made many things, like arepas wrapped in cloth with fried bacon for breakfast, and beans for lunch.
                            On that farm, we grew onions and tomatoes to make hogao, and also cidra and plantains, which we used for the “frisoles,” as we called them.<br>
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                        <p><br><br>
                            One day, we had to pack up and travel with the entire family. That morning, my father said to my mother,
                            “Come on, mija, get ready and get the girls ready — we’re all leaving.”
                            Edilma and I rode on a mule, and my father warned me not to whip the animal.
                            But I loved when the horses ran fast and the wind blew through my hair (I had it long, down to my waist), so I hit the mule with the whip — and it bolted with my sister and me on its back.
                            Since the saddle wasn’t tied properly, my sister fell underneath the mule.
                            My father was furious because I had disobeyed him, and he gave me two lashes with his belt.<br><br>

                            Very close to the farm in Santa Rita there was a crystal-clear stream called La Sevilla.
                            My mother and other women would go there to wash clothes, while we children splashed around nearby.
                            One of my fondest memories from that little stream is how my mother would wash upstream, and from farther down, her friends would shout,
                            “Oliva, let the girl come!”
                            Then she would wrap me in a sheet, leave my arms stretched out, and let me float for a moment with the current until the other women caught me downstream.
                            On the riverbank, there was a lot of grass — especially one called la mano poderosa (“the powerful hand”).
                            My mother would pick it, dry it, grind it, and mix the powder with water to make a paste she used to wash our hair.<br>

                            Before Julián — the son who was disappeared and killed by the army in 2008 — I had already lost another baby. Two months after that loss, in 1987, I became pregnant again, and Julián was born.
                            I was very happy during that pregnancy, even though I already had three children at the time.
                            We were living in Bogotá then, and I had to go alone to the Simón Bolívar Hospital, where my son was born on October 14, 1988. By that point, my water had broken five days earlier, so he had lost a lot of amniotic fluid.
                            As soon as I arrived, they induced labor.
                            Julián was born naturally but suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest, so he spent a day in the incubator.
                            The next day, we were discharged, and José came to pick us up in the afternoon.<br><br>

                            The first months of motherhood were calm, and I clearly remember one moment, about five days after his birth, when I was bathing him.
                            He yawned and stretched out his little arms for me to lift him from the tub.
                            At that moment, I felt such deep love that I made a promise:
                            that I would never be separated from him, no matter what happened.
                            That promise has kept us together, even after he was disappeared and killed.
                            It’s as if the umbilical cord we once shared still connects us.<br><br>
                            
                            The first word Julián ever said was Mama.
                            I felt so happy when I heard it<br><br>
                            When he was about three, when I bathed him, he would say “fío, fío,” and I’ve never forgotten it.
                            Now, whenever I feel col-12 col-md-6d, I say “fío.”<br><br>

                            We lived in a very small house, and my children always found clever ways to play hide-and-seek there.
                            The boys loved soccer and going out on little trips.

                But they showed him to me on a computer screen, in front of other young men, and asked, “Is Eduardo there?”

                            In 2004, when Julián reached adolescence, I began to feel an overwhelming fear that something bad might happen to him.
                            There were some boys following him who wanted to hurt him, so I had to take him out of school.<br><br>

                            One day, I went for a walk alone, sat by a cliff, and prayed to the Holy Spirit to give us a peaceful place for my children.
                            Not long after, we were told we would be relocated to Soacha.<br><br>

                            The move to Soacha was peaceful for me, but not for José, my husband.
                            Julián was already 17 and started working in a body shop in the neighborhood.
                            We managed to live calmly for three years — until his disappearance in 2008.<br><br>

                <p><br><br>
                    I know I’ve endured many hard blows, and I think my strength comes from love — because I love my children and my family deeply.
                    My strength also lies in being able to withstand all that has happened to me.
                    For instance, when my daughter was burned at two and a half years old — that was an immense pain, and I felt a deep guilt because everyone blamed me for what had happened to her.
                    Even now, my daughter still brings up that accident.<br><br>
