                            My name is Doris Tejada, and I was born in Montenegro, Quindío, on May 10, 1950. At that time, we lived on a farm with my mother, Ana Raquel Castañeda, my father, my eighteen brothers and sisters, the hens we raised, and a dairy cow. I was one of the youngest girls.<br><br>

                            Our life in Montenegro was calm and joyful.<br><br>

                            My mother was beautiful, patient, and caring. With love and gentleness, she taught us to plant, clean the house, cook, weave, and embroider. When I was eight years old, one day she said, “Let’s weave with some yarn and a needle,” and taught me how to make slippers and hats. At first my stitches came out wrong, and she made me undo everything. That frustrated me deeply because I hated taking apart what I had done.<br><br>

                            My mother gave me the two greatest gifts of my life: a hen and embroidery. I loved that hen so much — I talked to her, cuddled her, slept beside her, and even took her with me when I went to school or did homework.<br><br>

                            In the 1960s, during the conflict between Liberals and Conservatives, a pamphlet arrived at our house. It was a threat to my father, and that same night we had to flee to Bogotá. We left without packing anything, and I even had to leave my hen behind. That trip was deeply sad for me. The separation from my hen marked me for life. After that, I never again had pets, nor did I grow attached to a stuffed animal or any other creature in that same way.<br>
                        </p>

                            When I was ten, we arrived in Bogotá. We stayed at my aunt’s house in the Restrepo neighborhood, while my father found a job with the railway at the Sabana Station (right where the MAFAPO monument will be built). Soon after, my father applied for a housing loan with the Territorial Credit Institute, and that’s how we moved to the Timiza neighborhood, where we had our first family home in Bogotá. It was a modest unfinished house that required a lot of work from all of us to complete.<br><br>

                            The first big blow in my life came when I was eleven — my father’s death. One Saturday morning, my father went to work at the Sabana Station, and while he was having a cup of coffee outside, a car lost its brakes, drove onto the sidewalk, hit my father and other people, and he died instantly. At that time, I was sixteen and studying in eighth grade at the local Technical Commercial Institute. After his death and the financial hardship we faced, I had to leave school and start working to help my brothers and my mother.<br>

                            When I learned of his death, I felt an overwhelming shock — it was as if everything had ended for me. The feeling was so intense that I had to lie down for a while and focus only on my breathing. In that state of confusion, I left the house wearing two different shoes. When I arrived at the hospital, someone asked me, “Why are you wearing different shoes?”<br><br>

                            My father’s death was so sudden, unexpected, and painful. He was one of the most important people in my life, and it was incredibly hard to accept his departure — to accept that I would never see him again. With his death, the fever for embroidery returned to me.<br><br>

                            My first job, thanks to a very understanding uncle, was in his beauty salon. There I learned how to do manicures, and my very first paying client — believe it or not — was Lucho Herrera, the famous cyclist. He was a friend of my uncle’s and used to come to that salon to have his nails done.<br>

                    My son wanted so much to come into this world that he made sure his arrival was possible, no matter the cost. It was a difficult journey until he was born. At that time, Darío and I lived in Fusagasugá, though he worked in Bogotá. The day of the birth began strangely — very early that morning, I felt my love for Darío stir intensely, so I packed a few things, went out to the street, and got on a bus to Bogotá. I remember sitting in the middle to ease the movement and pain during the trip.<br>

                            When I was nineteen, I met Darío. A year later, we got married and moved to Fusagasugá.<br><br>

                            In the 1980s, I became pregnant — a pregnancy deeply desired and cherished. I remember I loved eating ripe raw plantains, oranges, bananas, and mangoes. Everything of that color made me feel good. During that time, I reconnected with weaving and embroidery. I bought materials and made little slippers, sweaters, and hats for my baby.<br><br>

                            My son wanted so much to come into this world that he made sure it happened, whatever it took. His birth was a long, difficult journey. That day started strangely — very early, I felt that surge of love for Darío, and since we lived in Fusagasugá though he worked in Bogotá, I packed my things, left the house, and took a bus. I remember sitting in the middle to ease the movement and pain.<br><br>

                            I arrived downtown, where Darío’s tailor shop was, and that’s when the labor pains began. He was so worried that we went out looking for a nearby hospital — and suddenly, my water broke right there on the sidewalk. Darío panicked and rushed me into a nearby church so the baby wouldn’t be born on the street.<br><br>

                            It wasn’t long before an ambulance picked us up. I was terrified and embarrassed, thinking they might take off my underwear right there — that was all I could think about.

                            After that long journey, we finally reached the Timiza hospital. Everything was chaotic because of the rain, and since the hospital was flooded, Óscar ended up being born on the stretcher that took me out of the ambulance. I remember the joy I felt when I held him for the first time — an immense joy. When I looked into his eyes, all the pain disappeared, and everything made sense in that instant. I believe the love that awakened in me that day, and the impulse to find my beloved Darío, opened the path for this birth. Through love and joy — when I reunited with Darío at the tailor shop — that’s how Óscar found his way into life.<br><br>

And among so many emotions, I didn’t realize in time that the happiness I felt —which I thought was the same joy I’d felt when I saw him born— was actually the sensation caused by my hypertension.

                            After Óscar disappeared, I took refuge in embroidery. I began making tiny shoes. At first, I made them without much purpose, selling them for 2,000 pesos each, and with that money I bought more materials. Two years ago, I began the mission of weaving 6,402 tiny colorful shoes. Since then, embroidery has taken on a deeper meaning for me: each little shoe holds within it the absence and memory of a disappeared person, and it is stitched with the emotions born from those absences. To me, those shoes are like amulets.<br><br>

                            My goal is to reach 6,402 embroidered shoes, representing the people who, like my son, were detained, disappeared, and extrajudicially killed. As of 2025, I have completed 4,886.

                <p><br><br>
                    Aún hoy siento el llamado del mal de madre, esa extraña ternura que se queda en el cuerpo después de haber dado vida, como si mi vientre guardara para siempre la memoria de los antojos y las sensaciones del embarazo. Es un amor que no se apaga, una sensibilidad que también se expresa en mi manera de cocinar. Para mí, la cocina es prolongar ese cuidado: cada plato lleva la ternura, la energía y la fuerza de la vida que una vez llevé dentro. Alimentar se vuelve un acto sagrado, un puente entre lo más profundo de mi cuerpo y la comunidad que me rodea.<br><br>

                    Cocinar me despierta el alma, me lleva a otros tiempos y a otros lugares. Me apasiona hacerlo en comunidad, en esas ollas grandes donde el compartir y el amor se mezclan con el aroma de los alimentos. Porque sé que al final es el amor lo que nos mueve, lo que teje un lazo indestructible entre las madres y sus hijos.<br><br>

                    La cocina me ha conectado con mi historia y con otras mujeres que, como yo, han caminado entre el dolor y la resistencia. Recuerdo la olla comunitaria que hicimos en Sibaté, haciendo los grafitis de “las cuchas tienen razón” y “las locas decimos la verdad”: allí preparé un sancocho, mi plato favorito, como homenaje a la memoria de quienes hemos perdido y como una apuesta por la esperanza de justicia y verdad.<br><br>
